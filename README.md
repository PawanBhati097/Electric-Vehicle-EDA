This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Electric Vehicles (EV) data. It provides insights into the distribution and growth of electric vehicles by year, state, and manufacturer. The analysis explores trends, geographical patterns, and the popularity of EVs across different regions. Key visualizations include bar charts and choropleths to illustrate state-wise EV counts and manufacturer distribution. The goal is to better understand the electric vehicle market and its expansion over time based on the available data.
